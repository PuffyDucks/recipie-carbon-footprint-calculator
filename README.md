# recipie carbon footprint calculator

## Overview
A web application that calculates the total carbon footprint of a user's meal. The user inputs the ingredients, and the web app displays the carbon emissions for each ingredient (and specifically where those emissions are coming from) as well as a pie chart of each ingredient's contribution to the overall carbon footprint of the meal. The goal is to make users more aware of their meals' carbon footprint and what ingredient alternatives might be more environmentally friendly.
