# recipie carbon footprint calculator

## Overview
A web application deployed on IBM Linuxone cloud that calculates the total carbon footprint of a user's meal. The user inputs the ingredients, and the web app displays the carbon emissions for each ingredient (and specifically where those emissions are coming from) as well as a pie chart of each ingrediant's contribution to the overall carbon footprint of the meal. The goal is to make users more aware of their meals' carbon footprint and what ingrediant alternatives might be more environmentally friendly.
